Problem Karnataka is facing.
Unemployment
Flood relief
GST Dues
MNERGA Dues
IBPS..

Modi is talking about
Pakistan
Kashmir
370
Ram Mandir.

Everything Modi spoke today is irrelevant to the problem state is facing.

So Karnataka is saying #GobackModi"

15 MLAs joined BJP

So total 1,500 Crores

Flood relief was just 1,800 Crores for more than 8 Lakhs Flood victims.

And 12,000 Crores for 137.4 Lakh Farmers?

Can't you see Corruption here?
